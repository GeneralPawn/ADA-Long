This platform will be a total of 6 levels with each level having individually 10 levels inside each one.
The amount of ADA to open each individual levels will vary depending on the amount of ADA able to stake per level, per individual return % per increasing levels.

Working with CCV pool ticker is something I have already discussed with the owner/operator. 
Each individual that runs through this ADA smart contract/Staking platform with also have an individual wallet specifically for this.
The wallet will operate 2 ways- 
1. Allowing each individual to add ADA to the platform to open additional levels, and stake what is requested per level.
2. A separate feature will be added to "lock in) a specific amount of ADA for a specific amount of time - example: 125ADA locked ðŸ”’ 365days.
Only during a "locked ADA" agreement will that specific ADA simultaneously be staked inside a separate CCV pool Allowing that "locked" ADA to gain a 6% APY.

Over View- 

ADA holders will now be able to not only increase their individual ADA in a short term stake investment by funding Short term (loans) , but then take the rewards from those % paid back to the ADA lenders and turn it into Long term investments via CCV pooling or using % ADA profits to re invest into bigger and better levels.

I believe this Platform can greatly enhance systems created already in the ADA community and on the CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY as a whole moving forward.
